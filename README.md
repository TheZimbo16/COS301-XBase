# COS-301-XBase

## Synopsis
  The UP campus can be tricky to navigate and finding information can be even trickier - The NavUp application is aimed at providing access to information, activities and venues to students, staff and vistors to the campus using smart devices.
## Motivation
This repository was put together to allow for collaboration for the xBase team in putting together an architectural design specification document for the second round of the COS-301 class project for 2017.
