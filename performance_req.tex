\subsection{Performance}
-Offline activities should have a response time of +/- 2 seconds (instantaneous) when responding to an activity, while online activities such as calculating routes should have a response time of +/- 2-4 seconds so that the users have an uninterrupted experience.\\
-It should also allow the integration of a variety of services.\\

\subsection{Reliability} 
-It should be able to handle +/- 50 000 users concurrently (simultaneously) when implemented into a suitable production environment. \\
-The application should be reliable, in that it will provide the fastest route every time without fail and complete all other computations successfully. \\
-All activities should be completed with a 0.1 error allowance.\\
-The application should provide accurate locations in a constantly changing environment.\\

\subsection{Security}
-Data transmission should be securely transmitted without unauthorized access, or loss of information.\\
