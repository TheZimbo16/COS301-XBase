- The system should be accessible on smart devices, such as Android and iOS devices.\\
- The system should not use GPS, but only the WiFi network. \\
- The proposed system should be able to be integrated into the Computer Science Department's Web site. \\
- The system should be a modular system, to reduce the dependencies in the system. \\
- Software Fault Tolerance: If a malfunction cannot be avoided, then the software design should be constrained so that the system can recover without causing damage to the system. \\
- The system should have an aesthetically pleasing and easy to use interface. \\
- The system must be able to run on smart devices which has limited processing power, battery life and storage space. The system must thus use resources efficiently. \\
- The system needs to use open source technologies. \\
